    <p>
    In this task, you have to pick two numbers (named X and Y) between 0 and 100 (both inclusive).
    Your payment for this task depends on how close these two numbers (X and Y) are to the so called ”target number”.
    The closer your numbers are to the target number, the higher your payment.
    Caclulation of the target number depends on your picked numbers.
    It is calculated as the mean of both numbers (X and Y), multiplied by two thirds: target number = 2 3  X + Y 2
    Your Payment depends on absolute distance of your numbers to the target number.
    For each number, if the number is exactly equal to the target number, you receive 1e.
    Should you not hit the target number exactly, some money will be deducted.
    35 For each absolute unit distance of your numbers to the target number, 0.05e will be deducted:
    payment for X = 1e − 0.05e |X − target number| payment for Y = 1e − 0.05e |Y − target number|
    Because only the absolute difference between your number and the target number is used to calculate your payment
    (indicated with by the vertical bars “|”), it does not matter whether you deviate upwards or downwards - only the absolute difference counts.
    Please note that your payment can not become negative.
    Should your payment according to the above formula become negative, you will receive 0e instead.
    You have four minutes time to pick both numbers.
    After you have chosen your numbers, please confirm your choice by clicking the red “continue” button.
    Otherwise, your answer will not be recorded.
