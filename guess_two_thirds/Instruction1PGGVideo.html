    <p>
    In this task, you have to pick two numbers (named X and Y) between 0 and 100 (both inclusive).
    Your payment for this task depends on how close these two numbers (X and Y) are to the so called ”target number”.
    The closer your numbers are to the target number, the higher your payment.
    Calculation of the target number depends on your picked numbers.
    It is calculated as the mean of both numbers (X and Y), multiplied by two thirds: $$\text{target number} \; = \; \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{X+Y}{2} \right) $$
    Your Payment depends on absolute distance of your numbers to the target number.
    For each number, if the number is exactly equal to the target number, you receive 1000 points.
    Should you not hit the target number exactly, some points will be deducted.
    For each absolute unit distance of your number to the target number, 50 points will be deducted:
    $$\text{payment for} \; X \; = \; 1000 − 50*|X − \text{target number}|$$ and $$\text{payment for} \; Y \; = \; 1000 − 50*|Y − \text{target number}|$$
    Because only the absolute difference between your number and the target number is used to calculate your payment
    (indicated with by the vertical bars “|”), it does not matter whether you deviate upwards or downwards - only the absolute difference counts.
    Please note that your payment for the task can not become negative.
    Should your total payment for both numbers according to the above formulas become negative, you will receive 0 points instead.
    After this Instruction you will additionally be asked what my favorite number is, to prove you read the instructions.
    The Number is 752. You will receive additional 200 Points for answering correctly.
    After you have picked X and Y, confirm your choice by clicking the “continue” button.
    Otherwise, your answer will not be recorded.
    Points are converted in a ration of 1:1000 into $. When making your decision you will be displayed these Instructions again.
