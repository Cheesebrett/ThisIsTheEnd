<p>
You will now play a pattern game, where you are asked to solve some puzzles.
    On the screen, you will see a set of abstract pictures with one of the pictures missing.
    You need to choose a picture from the choices below to complete the pattern, like in the example below.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="{% static 'raven_matrices/example.jpg' %}" alt="Trulli" width="466" height="500" class="center">
<p>
<p>
In this example 8 is the correct answer. You will have a total of 4 minutes to complete 6 such puzzles. During these 4 minutes you will be able to move forwards and backwards and change your
    answers using the buttons and tabs on your screen. The puzzles get more difficult.</p>
<p>
Once the 4 minutes have passed, the pattern game will be automatically submitted. You can submit on the last page you reach by clicking on the button that will appear and be labelled "Finish and proceed to next step".</p>
<p>
You will earn {{C.EARNING_PER_ITEM}} USD (approx. INR 20) per the number of correct answers you submitted.</p>
